# Cool App

A simple way to look or create groups that have upcoming activities in your local area

## Technologies Used
React
Springboot
SQL


## Application Objectives 
We were asked to solve a specific problem for a specific group or individual person. We decided to focus on people who have had a hard time finding activities, since the restrictions of the pandemic have been lifted. The restrictions caused by Covid have caused major effects to our social lifes. Quarantine has limited our interactions with friends and family causing many of us to drop our hobbies. Now that things are getting back to normal a lot of us are having a hard time reconnecting with others and picking up our old interests. 

## Description

"Cool app" was created to let people find events that are close or near your living area. Once an account is created, users can navigate throughout the site to look for specific activities that lets you filter through events to find exactly what you're interested in. Look through the event list or pull up our map to find any event that catches your interests. Our application uses google maps API to lets us render Google Maps into our react component, which lets us place our custom markers anywhere around the globe. Once you find a group let others know your interested by signing up or by creating an event to let others participate in a hobby you love.
